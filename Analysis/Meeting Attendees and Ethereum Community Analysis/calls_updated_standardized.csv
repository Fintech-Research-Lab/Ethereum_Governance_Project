ACD Note for YOLOv2 (From: Hudson and James):
We want to focus on what should be included in YOLOv2 rather than what is officially going into Berlin because there are things like benchmarking and further evaluation of CFI (considered for inclusion) EIPs that usually advance an EIP from CFI to Accepted.

We recommend considering the following EIPs for YOLOv2. Note that not all of these EIPs are in CFI, but are to be discussed in ACD Meeting #95.

EIP-2046: Reduced gas cost for static calls made to precompiles.
EIP-2315: Simple Subroutines for the EVM.
EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations (already in YOLOv1).
EIP-2711: Sponsored, expiring and batch transactions.
EIP 2718: Typed Transaction Envelope (general-purpose standard for adding new transaction types).
EIP-2565: Repricing of the EIP-198 ModExp precompile.
EIP-2929: Gas cost increases for state access opcodes.
EIP-2930: Optional access lists.
EIP-2935: Save historical block hashes in state.

Post EIP 1011 (Hybrid Casper) Spec Plans
Now that EIP 1011 is deprecated, is there still the interest among client developers to have a joint testnet, a Ropsten-successor if you want to put it like that?
If yes, and I assume most of us are interested in some effort like this, how could it look like if not like the hybrid Casper proposal?
What smaller steps can/should we take in the meantime while waiting for casper+sharding? (can we just call it ""shasper"" now?)
