This document replicates the Ethereum project data creation document. This data is designed to empirically test how Ethereum makes decision about finalizing Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). This project will collect data on EIPs, their status and their authors. This will be supplemented by information about the authors like their twitter and github following, their current and past work history, job titles, and their author's cross-collaboration. We will also identify whether authors belong to Ethereum Client or not. In addition to author information, we will also look at the information about the content of EIPs, we will look at the sentiments on different EIPs by Ethereum community on Magician and we will catagorize discussion topics of Ethereum's development calls where these EIPs are discussed. 
# Data Collection Process
## Creation of Unique Author Ids
The data collection process begins with scraping of data from the website ethereum.org. This website contains information of all EIPs, their status and their authors. This data is collected using a web-scrapping code as of **06/21/2023**. At that point there were 639 EIPs. The output of this file is contained in the file called *"allEIPs.csv."* In parallel, we manually collected twitter following and author's company and jobs data. This process created multiple "formats" of author names. We needed to ensure that author names are uniquely identified. Therefore, to create unique author_ids for each of the authors, we first split authors into author1 to author11, assigned author_ids to the authors as a sequence in the order of EIP numbers, and then used name matching algorithms to match names in twitter, linkedIn, and github data author names. This code is in the file *"Author Name Matching.R"* The name matching process produced a list of all authors of EIPs with a unique author_id. This file is stored in *unique_author_names_with_id.csv"*
