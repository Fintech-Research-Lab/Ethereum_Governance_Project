In doing the migration/cleanup, I found some EIP references to EIPs that don't actually exist.  In these cases I tried to excise the reference from the EIP as best I could.

Allowing users to sign messages to show intent of execution, but allowing a third party relayer to execute them is an emerging pattern being used in many projects.

In some cases, people were using markdown citations, I suspect because the long-form was a bit verbose to inline.  Since the relative path is quite short, I moved these to inline but I wouldn't be opposed to putting them back to citation format if that is desired by the authors.

In doing the migration/cleanup, I found some EIP references to EIPs that don't actually exist.  In these cases I tried to excise the reference from the EIP as best I could.

eip-1240.md,"Creates Remove Difficulty Bomb EIP (#1240)

* Creates Remove Difficulty Bomb EIP

The difficulty bomb operates under the assumption that miners decide what code economic participants are running, rather than economic participants deciding for themselves. In reality, miners will mine whatever chain is most profitable and the most profitable chain is the one that economic participants use. If 99% of miners mine a chain that no economic participants use then that chain will have no value and the miners will cease mining of it in favor of some other chain that does have economic participants. Another way to put this is that miners will follow economic participants, not the other way around.

With the difficulty bomb removed, when Casper is released it will be up to economic participants to decide whether they want the features that Casper enables or not. If they do not want Casper, they are free to continue running unpatched clients and participating in the Ethereum network as it exists today. This freedom of choice is the cornerstone of DLTs and making it hard for people to make that choice (by creating an artificial pressure) does not work towards that goal of freedom of choice. If the development team is not confident that economic participants will want Casper, then they should re-evaluate their priorities rather than trying to force Casper onto users.

Personal Note: I think we will see almost all economic participants in Ethereum switch to PoS/Sharding without any extra pressure beyond client defaults.

In doing the migration/cleanup, I found some EIP references to EIPs that don't actually exist.  In these cases I tried to excise the reference from the EIP as best I could.

It is worth noting that the Readme actually already had this rule, it just wasn't expressed properly in EIP-1 and the ""Citation Format"" section of the readme I think caused people a bit of confusion (when citing externally, you should use the citation format).",2020-09-30 04:22:43+00:00,137,Ethereum Domain Name Service - Specification,Nick Johnson,Final

eip-152.md,"EIP-152: Blake2b `F` precompile (#2129)

* Brought issue #152 into the repo as a draft EIP.

Thanks @tjade273!

* Make the draft EIP consistent with the template

Also added myself as an author

* Break backwards compatibility into its own section

* Added notes about the in-progress implementation

Should have a working geth precompile and initial benchmarks shortly

* Specify EIP-2046 as a requirement

While 2046's cheaper precompile contract calls aren't a requirement for
this EIP's implementation, shipping this precompile without EIP-2046
would make the F function expensive for some of the motivating usecases.

* Don't use ABI encoding for precompile

Replace the existing ABI encoding interface to the BLAKE2b `F`
precompile with a loosely pack struct that's `staticcall`-friendly.

H/t to @pdyraga for putting together the interface!

* Add @pdyraga to the EIP authors.

* Remove less relevant EIP rationale

Let's not relitigate precompiles, WASM, etc in thie EIP :)

* Use 0x09 as the precompile address

If a conflicting EIP is moving forward the EIP editor can assign a new
address

* Choosing an EIP number

Contributing docs suggest EIPs be named `eip-draft-with-a-title` until
an editor has been assigned, but discussing this work off-platform
without a number is a problem.

Assigning 152 as the issue number where the `F` precompile was
originally raised (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/152)

* Add a missing colon

Thanks @axic 🙌

* Spelling updates

* Add @MadeOfTin to the authors list

* Prefer the original issue for discussion

* Clarify the precompile's initial implementation

* Make the precompile return value clear

* Clean up references wording

* More rationale around this BLAKE2b approach

* Fix a couple misspellings

* Updated the interface for F precompile

- F precompile accepts now `abi.encodePacked` parameters taking 
exactly 213 bytes. This is safer and does not require left-padding data
- `rounds` parameter is now the first one as the gas cost depends only
on this parameter

* Updated gas cost section proposing GFROUND=1

* Detailed benchmarks moved to appendix section

* Benchmark stats are compared against ecRecover as a baseline

* Clarification: f parameter is true if it is nonzero

This rule is compatible with Solidity for boolean.

* Avoid referring to abi.encodePacked

The specification should not be Solidity-specific. Instead of
referring to abi.encodePacked we now just say ""tightly encoded"".

* Fixed incorrect link

""specified in the RFC"" linked to the geth PR for F precompile
instead of linking to the BLAKE2b RFC.

* Shortened the description about when parameter f is considered as true

* Minor grammar improvement

* Updated information about endianness of F precompile inputs

BLAKE2b is consistently little-endian. abi.encodePacked encodes each 
of its arguments in big-endian order. We need to be clear which parameters
should go as little-endian (h, m, t) and which parameters should go as 
big-endian (rounds, f).

* Strict validation of f parameter

* Initial test vectors for F precompile

Test cases covered:
- input length too short
- input length too long
- malformed f flag encoding
- correct input, test vector from BLAKE2b RFC, Appendix A

* Test vector for a non-final round

* Test vector for the maximum number of rounds

* Test vector for a single round

* Added test vector for empty input

* The final block indicator (8-bit word) does not have endianness

* Clarify state vector encoding does not change in the output

* Put too short input test vector next to empty input test vector

In doing the migration/cleanup, I found some EIP references to EIPs that don't actually exist.  In these cases I tried to excise the reference from the EIP as best I could.

It is worth noting that the Readme actually already had this rule, it just wasn't expressed properly in EIP-1 and the ""Citation Format"" section of the readme I think caused people a bit of confusion (when citing externally, you should use the citation format).",2020-09-30 04:22:43+00:00,1884,Repricing for trie-size-dependent opcodes,Martin Holst Swende,Final

* Add permissions system draft

* Fix typo, add missing link, one language change

**Previously:**
>Today web3 browsers like MetaMask always prompt on a per-action basis, but this maximizes security at the cost of user friction. An alternative model of security is to allow applications to request a series of permissions from a user at a time.

**Now:**
>Today web3 browsers like MetaMask always prompt on a per-action basis. This provides security at the cost of substantial user friction. We believe that a single permissions request can achieve the same level of security with vastly improved UX.

**Reasoning:** The former can be interpreted to imply that the permissions model is ""less secure."" The goal of the updated wording is to preclude that interpretation.

* Add ERC for wallet_getOwnedTokens JSON-RPC method

* Add EIP number & discussions URL to EIP-2256

* Fix wallet_getOwnedTokens input arguments

* Add chainId as argument to wallet_getOwnedTokens

As suggested in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2256#issuecomment-526204181

* Rename EIP-2256 method to wallet_getOwnedAssets, align data struct with EIP-747

Based on the discussions up to and including this comment: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-2256-add-wallet-getownedassets-json-rpc-method/3600/15

- rename `wallet_getOwnedTokens` to `wallet_getOwnedAssets`
- use `options` in the response field, as EIP-747 proposes, to allow for different asset-specific information to be returned
- use `asset` instead of `token` where generalization is needed
- replace `interface` with `type`, to align with EIP-747
- add `types` as a filter field
- add `decimals` as an optional field in `options`

* Fix category for EIP-2256 - use Interface

As suggested in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2256#discussion_r321153237

* Add justification field for EIP-2256, s/count/limit

- add `justification` field in the request arguments, as suggested in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2256#issuecomment-527683267
- replace `count` with `limit`, as `count` is more ambiguous (as revealed in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2253#discussion_r320140105)",2019-09-06 13:33:09+00:00,"(bot 1272989785) moving EIPS/eip-2256.md to stagnant (#3944)

I have gone through and updated all existing EIPs to match this rule, including EIP-1.

In some cases, people were using markdown citations, I suspect because the long-form was a bit verbose to inline.  Since the relative path is quite short, I moved these to inline but I wouldn't be opposed to putting them back to citation format if that is desired by the authors.

In doing the migration/cleanup, I found some EIP references to EIPs that don't actually exist.  In these cases I tried to excise the reference from the EIP as best I could.

It is worth noting that the Readme actually already had this rule, it just wasn't expressed properly in EIP-1 and the ""Citation Format"" section of the readme I think caused people a bit of confusion (when citing externally, you should use the citation format).",2020-09-30 04:22:43+00:00,2384,Muir Glacier Difficulty Bomb Delay,Eric Conner,Final

eip-3091.md,"EIP-3091: Block Explorer API Routes (#3091)

Providing wallet with a `blockExporerUrl` could be valuable given that applications can permissionessly interface with each other given that standards are followed and become interoperable.

Hence I've explored existing block explorers and identified existing patterns where these endpoints are in consensus and could be specified under a standard which this EIP describes

### L1 Blockchain Explorers

#### Blocks
Blockscout (chainId=100) -> https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/blocks/<BLOCK_HASH_OR_HEIGHT>
Etherscan (chainId=1) -> https://etherscan.io/block/<BLOCK_HASH_OR_HEIGHT>
Etherchain (chainId=1) -> https://etherchain.org/block/<BLOCK_HASH_OR_HEIGHT>
Ethplorer (chainId=1) -> unsupported

Etherscan and Etherchain are in consensus for blocks endpoint but Blockscout uses `/blocks` endpoint instead and Ethplorer doesn't have a page for blocks so returns 404 not found.

#### Transactions
Blockscout (chainId=100) -> https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/tx/<TX_HASH>
Etherscan (chainId=1) -> https://etherscan.io/tx/<TX_HASH>
Etherchain (chainId=1) -> https://etherchain.org/tx/<TX_HASH>
Ethplorer (chainId=1) -> https://ethplorer.io/tx/<TX_HASH>

All block explorers are in consensus for transactions endpoint.

#### Accounts
Blockscout (chainId=100) -> https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
Etherscan (chainId=1) -> https://etherscan.io/address/<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
Etherchain (chainId=1) -> https://etherchain.org/account/<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
Ethplorer (chainId=1) -> https://ethplorer.io/address/<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>

All block explorers are in consensus for accounts endpoint except Etherchain which uses `/account` endpoint instead

#### ERC-20 Tokens
Blockscout (chainId=100) -> https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/tokens/<TOKEN_ADDRESS>
Etherscan (chainId=1) -> https://etherscan.io/token/<TOKEN_ADDRESS>
Etherchain (chainId=1) -> https://etherchain.org/token/<TOKEN_ADDRESS>
Ethplorer (chainId=1) -> https://ethplorer.io/address/<TOKEN_ADDRESS>

Etherscan and Etherchain are in consensus but Blockscout uses `/tokens` endpoint instead and Ethplorer doesn't have a page for tokens so redirects to accounts page (`/address`).

### L2 Explorers

#### Blocks
Matic -> https://explorer.matic.network/blocks/<BLOCK_HEIGHT_OR_HASH>
zkScan -> https://zkscan.io/blocks/<BLOCK_NUMBER>
Fuel -> https://rinkeby.fuel.sh/block/<BLOCK_NUMBER>

#### Transactions
Matic -> https://explorer.matic.network/tx/<TX_HASH>
zkScan -> https://zkscan.io/transactions/<TX_HASH>
Fuel -> https://rinkeby.fuel.sh/tx/<TX_HASH>

#### Accounts
Matic -> https://explorer.matic.network/address/<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
zkScan -> https://zkscan.io/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
Fuel -> https://rinkeby.fuel.sh/address/<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>

#### ERC-20 Tokens
Matic -> https://explorer.matic.network/tokens/<TOKEN_ADDRESS>
zkScan -> unsupported (`/tokens` displays a list of tokens pointing to L1 explorer)
Fuel -> unsupported

Co-authored-by: lightclient <14004106+lightclient@users.noreply.github.com>

- Added file with link to reference implementation since I could not add the entire reference implementation repo as a folder under assets/eip-4910

* adding reference implementation folder

* Updates in response to requests by @SamWilsn

- Removed all external links
- Added Licensing to the header of the solidity contracts
- Split Specifications and Rationales into separate section to align with EIP-1
- Intended the sections properly based on suggestion by @SamWilsn

* Overlooked two external links, and removed them

* Update EIPS/eip-4910.md

Co-authored-by: Sam Wilson <57262657+SamWilsn@users.noreply.github.com>

* Address requested changes by @SamWilsn

- adopted suggestion by @SamWilsn to simplify headers and remove `Rationale` headers and remove the individual `Specification` headers.
- found a way to remove  requirements as headers using <a name=""tag_name"">...</a>

* Minor function update to adding and removing a NFT listing

* Updated the functions the wrong way

* Addressing Editor comment 4/22/2022

- Fixing overlooked heading corrections per comment by @SamWilsn
- Minor editing in the outline section to remove some headings to simplify the flow

* Update EIPS/eip-4910.md

Co-authored-by: Pandapip1 <45835846+Pandapip1@users.noreply.github.com>

* Update based on discussion with @SamWilsn on 5/17

- removed specific data structure structs and just generally talked about what things are required to be held in the smart contract
- consequently removed 3 requirements
- removed all optional [O] and conditional [CR] requirements
- removed all but 1 should [D] requirements

Decision of the call was also not to split the EIP into several EIPs since that does not reduce overall complexity, and makes creating reference implementations more difficult, hurting adoption.

Net effect is to noticeably reduce the size of the specification.

* Missed two unhyphenated ERC references -- fixed

* Fixing EIP and HTML Validator errors save for reference implementation link

* added separate rationale section for the spec

* fixed link for EIP-20

* fixing links

* Removed reference implementation and updated relevant section in the EIP accordingly

* Update EIPS/eip-4910.md

This EIP was written in a time when we were using EIPs for hardfork coordination and we weren't worried too much about link rot.  However, times have changed and maintaining EIPs like this is becoming more and more of a burden.  In this case, the specification is what is important, not who implements it.  Also, editors do not want to maintain external links to things that don't add *significant* value.

by (e.g.) [the Ethers signer][1] and [the OpenZeppelin validator][2], as
well as with the start of the ""Specification"" section of this EIP.

* Further commentary on transaction fee amount for full nodes vs miner tx fees

* Add ""One problem with this is that a miner could run a full node validator using a different address with the same computer, and just cache the result of their execution and use it for the full node validator. I'm not sure how you would prevent this, but perhaps you could using IP address tracking (similarly asserting that the IP address of a full node validator isn't the same as the miner) which would add additional complexity to the protocol, but this could also be hacked with dynamic IPs and VPNs.""

* he user agent would contain the information needed to send an amount of ETH to the full node and the client, which are the addresses of these parties and the amounts to add. I think full nodes would need to add to their set up to add the address to receive ETH after validating transactions. These fields could be read-only, or immutable, so that someone can't overwrite them with another address, thus preventing one possible attack.

* Several functional updates

Upon review from a wider audience, this commit includes an interface definition of minimum functionality for mined tokens, a more comprehensive abstract contract that defines required behavior for 4 separate internal phases of solution verification, difficulty modification, epoch period updates, and token reward. Additionally added an example mining program and several simple and complex examples are referenced. Included main net deployed implementation contract addresses 0xbitcoin and PoWAdv. Updated new header format per EIP standardization.
